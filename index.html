    <h2>Yellowstone Photo Log ~ July 2022</h2>
    <p>After two long years of waiting, for obvious reasons, Jaimie and I finally got to go on a trip to Yellowstone
      National Park. The natural beauty of the American West is stunning, and Yellowstone is like a crown jewel.
      Yellowstone is teeming with things to do and see. We stayed four days and still only fit in a small fraction of
      the sights to view. I think I was on a phone diet, so I didn't take many photos. We also decided to camp, on our
      way to and from the park, which turned out sweaty, but great! At the park, Cathy and James managed to book us four
      nights, two nights at the Old Faithful Inn, and two at the Cabins behind The Yellowstone Hotel.</p>

      <figcaption>
        Our first night we stayed at the Bruneau Dunes outside of Boise in southern Idaho. Needless to say it was hot,
        92F at 10:30PM üò• Besides being a bird sanctuary, and sporting a big sandy dune, the park had a building to
        house a huge 15 foot tall telescope. We sat through a movie about light pollution, and got to see some stars,
        and galaxies! üåÉ We declined the 'Scorpion Walk' ü¶Ç Apparently they were abundant in the area.

        Most of the hydrothermal features had unique names. Our favorite one was The Hook n' Cook. It was named because
        fishermen would dip their catch, still on the rod, in the hot water to instantly boil it.

    <h2>Leavenworth Photo Log ~ December 2021</h2>
    <p>This December we got the chance to take a trip to the lovely Bavarian themed town of
      Leavenworth, WA. We were invited by our friends, Jacquie & Johnny, who we met through Jaimie's
      grad program at Lewis & Clark (2 years left ü•≤ until Jacquie & Jaimie are school psychologists!).
      Needless to say we had a wonderful time drinking beer and enjoying the snow ‚òÉÔ∏è during such
      a festive time of year.</p>

    <h2>Spokane Photo Log ~ November 2021</h2>
    <p>Jaimie and I recently went to visit my family in Spokane.
      We had a great time seeing my sister Jessie and her two dogs Dunkel and Odin,
      as well as getting to spend more time with Jessie's husband Nolan, and Nolan's parents Juanita, and Craig. Spokane
      is a beautiful city
