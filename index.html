     <h2>Leavenworth Photo Log ~ December 2021</h2>
     <p>This December we got the chance to take a trip to the lovely Bavarian themed town of
       Leavenworth, WA. We were invited by our friends, Jacquie & Johnny, who we met through Jaimie's
       grad program at Lewis & Clark (2 years left ü•≤ until Jacquie & Jaimie are school psychologists!).
       Needless to say we had a wonderful time drinking beer and enjoying the snow ‚òÉÔ∏è during such
      a festive time of year.</p>

      <h2>Spokane Photo Log ~ November 2021</h2>
      <p>Jaimie and I recently went to visit my family in Spokane. 
          We had a great time seeing my sister Jessie and her two dogs Dunkel and Odin,
        as well as getting to spend more time with Jessie's husband Nolan, and Nolan's parents Juanita, and Craig. Spokane is a beautiful city
    this time of year, and I feel like Jaimie and I took full advantage!</p>
